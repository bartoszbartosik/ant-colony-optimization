# Ant Colony Optimization
This metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on ants behaviour attempts to find the most optimal solution of a given problem expressed in a form of graph $G$ expressed as a tuple of components $C$ and connections $L$, i.e., $G = (C, L)$. There are many variations of its implementation. The one that has been adapted in this project is the _Ant System_.
